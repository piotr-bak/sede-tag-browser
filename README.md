# SEDE Tag Browser

This is minimal app, allowing to browse tags you can come across StackOverflow.

## Why is it here?
My idea was to keep it rather simple, yet with enough modularity to easliy extend it when the time (and fresh ideas) will come.

## How to check it out on your own machine?

All you need is to just pick up your favorite package manager (in my case it is pnpm) and fire it "as usuall":

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
If you prefer other methods: 
```bash
npm ci
npm start
```
will work just fine too.
Enjoy!
